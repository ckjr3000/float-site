        introducing her ongoing interest on heat and temperature. Ryoko has been
        examining on various methods to amplify the sound of water dripping onto
        hotplates to create rhythmic patterns. She will discuss her idea,
        demonstrate its process, and discuss achievement and issues.

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>
        FLOAT is a casual monthly meetup in Huddersfield for anyone who
        identifies as queer, belonging to a minority gender, or a woman,
        interested in creative technology. This could be creative coding, web
        design, digital art, game development, electronic/digital music or
        something else we haven't thought of!
      </p>
      <p>
        Meetups last roughly two hours, with free hot & cold drinks available.
        We aim to include some kind of activity in each session, whether it's a
        quick presentation, skill share, or discussion on a pre-decided topic.

    <section id="when">
      <h3>When?</h3>
      <p>The first Thursday of every month. 17.30 - 19.30.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
        To create a friendly, inclusive space 'of our own', for those
        traditionally exluded from more tech-y creative scenes and industries.
        Hopefully, FLOAT can be the seed of new collaborations, projects, skill
        exchanges and friendships.
